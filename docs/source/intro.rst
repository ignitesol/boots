Introduction
==============

Fabric is a framework for simplifying the development of high volume, highly scalable distributed systems. The framework is an extensible set of abstractions for
developing servers that serve, consume or participate in unicast or multicast network communications. Fabric makes it easy to create uniform ways to configure, adminster, 
debug and compose servers.

Concepts
=========

Fabric introduces two core concepts. Servers are logically independent entities that provide specific capabilities in the 'distributed fabric'. Servers may have one or more 
endpoints that provide a termination (port) of inbound, outbound or peer-to-peer communication.
