Boots is a framework for simplifying the development of high volume, highly scalable managed distributed systems. Boots provides a set of building blocks that are wired together in an easy (and extensible) manner to build robust systems that serve, consume or participate in unicast or multicast network communications. Boots makes it easy to create uniform ways to configure, adminster, debug and compose servers.


- In the simplest cases, boots makes it easy to build web servers with configuration, logging, session, caching and error handling.

- You can quickly increase the capabilities to include authentication and invoking HTTP services (from other servers) synchronously or asynchronously.

- Build on this even further to create Managed Servers that will provide load balancing, clustering, health monitoring and run time reconfiguration.

- Alternately, or in addition, support high volume, high efficiency multicast communication through boots' abstractions for message queueing. Add database persistence through boots' abstractions for databases.

- Build on these capabilities or add your own to support a managed infrastructure on which application logic can be built.
